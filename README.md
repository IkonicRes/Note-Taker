## Description
I wanted to showcase my understanding of ExpressJS middleware and create an application where the user can take notes. It has the ability to post, view and delete created notes and stores them by UUID, so you can put as many duplicates as you want. This project will use Heroku to be run on official servers

## Installation
Run "npm install" to install dependencies, then run "node server.js", wherein the server will start on 127.0.0.1:5001

## Usage
Visit 127.0.0.1:5001 if you are running on a local server, otherwise the application is deployed at heroku ->[here](https://you-noted-a64d6c755938.herokuapp.com/)  
 Click start to begin, add a note if youd like by typing in the note input fields and pressing the save button. Click on any note to navigate to it for viewing, and the red trashcan icon to delete it.
